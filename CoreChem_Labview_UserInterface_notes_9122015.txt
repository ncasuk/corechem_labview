preflight:

how do AERACK and COREDLUs manage inop data streams?

preflight tab: shoudl list basic CB making sequence (pwrdist photo), and anything else not specific to instruments
then call operator to act on specific inst tabs

each instrument tab should have a preflight popup button/box for sanity checks (flows...), using photos and flow diags as props



inst tabs

should have preflight popup button
main flow diag with overlay realtime indicators, and charting button

System overview
as well as overall rack plumbing diagram
SAMPUMP MFM, cRIO temp
add Calib Synch selector switch
Caldeck valves LEDs?




Steph to produce plumbing ref diag for CO gases (SS2H panel)

also revised AL5002 with correct labelling, calib sequence timing for calib & zero valves indicators, flow diag to include cylinders/press transmits

revised FGGA flow diag (with caldeck and eV1), also preflight gas stowage info/piccies for popup (as per CO)

revised SO2 flow diag (with caldeck and eV8), See Freya's

all visio diagrams to be saved as .gif, using screen resolution, and 1200 x 750 pixels custom size (MAX size for FM laptop screen which
we believe is on 1280 x 960 resolution)








diagnostics trace charting

start with 120 min buffered time base reduce to 60 min if too heavy

give Charlie a list of grouped diagnostics (eg Temp, Flow, press) per instrument
to reduce # of charts

give Charlie a list of min/max alarm/margins for red/amber/green traffic light (y-scaling)

give Charlie the volt-bar scaling equation for deliv & content press transmi
