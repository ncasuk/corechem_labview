field,type,max_chars,description
$TEIOZO01,text,8,Identifies which device created the packet
packet_length,unsigned_int,3,the length of the packet (not including all characters up-to the comma which follows this number)
utc_time,unsigned_int,10,the valid time for this packet (usually 1 second behind actual time)
ptp_sync,text,1,"indication of whether the CRIO is successfully synchronised to PTP time ( 1 = synced, 0 = not-synced )"
crio_temp,unsigned_int,3,equals the internal bench temperature of the device
flight_num,text,5,"indicates the flight number for this packet ( an ""empty"" string here indicates that the CRIO hasn't been assigned a flight number )"
crio_fpga_run,text,1,"indicates whether the FPGA code is running ( a value toggling e.g. 1-0-1-0?etc shows running code, fixed value = non running )"
crio_rtc_run,text,1,"indicates whether the realtime code is running ( a value toggling e.g. 1-0-1-0?etc shows running code, fixed value = non running )"
crio_status,text,1,"- currently unused but for future use (boolean, therefore 0,1 )"
crio_UDP_num,unsigned_int,6,this number starts @ zero and increments with each UDP packet - used for verification of packet stream
crio_aux_out1,text,6,"- currently unused but for future use ( text, max string size = 6 characters )"
crio_aux_out2,text,6,"- currently unused but for future use ( text, max string size = 6 characters )"
crio_aux_out3,text,6,"- currently unused but for future use ( text, max string size = 6 characters )"
conc,single_float,8,Reading in signed engineering unit (ppb) for Ozone Signal
benchtemp,single_float,5,Bench temperature (degC) used in instrument calculations (temperature compensation is on)
press,single_float,5,Absorption cell pressure reading (mmHg) used in instrument calculation (pressure compensation on)
cellAint,unsigned_int,6,Lamp A intensity (Hz)
cellBint,unsigned_int,6,Lamp B intensity (Hz)
FlowA,single_float,5,Sample flow in cell A (L per min)
FlowB,single_float,5,Sample flow in cell B (L per min)
lamptemp,single_float,5,Lamp temperature (degC)
flag,text,8,"Status of the device, including alarms in 8 Hex digits"
