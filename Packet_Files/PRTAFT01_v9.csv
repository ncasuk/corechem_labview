$PRTAFT01,text,8,"this is the identifier for the start of the PRTAFT01 UDP packet"
packet_length,>unsigned_int,3,"the length of the packet (not including all characters up-to the comma which follows this number)"
utc_time,>unsigned_int,10,"the valid time for this packet (usually 1 second behind actual time)"
ptp_sync,boolean,1,"indication of whether the CRIO is successfully synchronised to PTP time ( 1 = synced, 0 = not-synced )"
crio_temp,>unsigned_int,3,"the internal hardware temperature of the CRIO"
flight_num,text,5,"indicates the flight number for this packet ( an ""empty"" string here indicates that the CRIO hasn't been assigned a flight number )"
crio_fpga_run,boolean,1,"indicates whether the FPGA code is running ( a value toggling e.g. 1-0-1-0…etc shows running code, fixed value = non running )"

rad_alt,>signed_int,5,"the radio altitude taken from the ARINC429 bus (reading is in feet x 4)"
unused_1,boolean,1,"an unused boolean (true,false) placeholder"
unused_2,boolean,1,"an unused boolean (true,false) placeholder"
deiced_temp_flag,boolean,1,"a boolean flag to indicate whether the temperature deicing heater is on or off"
wow_flag,boolean,1,"a boolean flag to indicate whether the aircraft is on the ground or in flight"
